Britain is on the verge of adopting the Digital Economy Bill without debate or scrutiny by Parliament. Among other things, the DEB provides for disconnection of entire households from the 'net if any member is accused -- without proof -- of infringing copyright.
<p>
Jim Killock from the UK Open Rights Group sez, "On Thursday, our 'Police' visited the offices of the BPI, Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour parties, and UK Music, and presented them with notice that the Digital Economy Bill is disconnected, from democracy, human rights, public opinion and sound business sense."

<br clear="all"><P>
Clicking into an article by Aimee Mullins, a double below knee amputee, actress, track athlete, and total babe, resulted in a moment of groaning "what the hell" at my computer screen. The article -- "<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5401408/is-choosing-a-prosthesis-so-different-than-picking-a-pair-of-glasses">Is Choosing a Prosthesis so Different than Picking a Pair of Glasses?</a>"  -- spoke of how prosthetics have evolved to the point of being as specialized and aesthetically unique as eyeglasses in the last fifty years in the United States.

<p>To illustrate her point, Mullins notes:

<blockquote>"...no one has yet to build a leg that does it all --- I have to change legs when I want to wear high heels; I have to change legs when I want to wear different height high heels; I have to change legs when I want to swim, take a boxing class at the gym, or sprint on the track. I have 12 pair in all (though many are housed in museums)." </blockquote>

<p>While the there are indeed parallels, the article largely neglects the enormous burden of cost and limited access to this cutting-edge technology that so often gets featured in the press.  Those very legs that Mullins has relegated to museums sit well out of financial reach for the majority of the disabled community.

<p>Full disclosure: I myself am a double amputee; being born without legs. No stumps, femurs, or anything. I start at the pelvis.  I never experienced the contrast of pre/post disability. I grew up thinking of myself as whole and complete.  Whenever I was confronted with a set of legs, they felt like highly impractical stilts designed with aesthetics over function in mind. <p>I remember always feeling a mix of awkwardness and obligation when I slid into the big, wobbly, pair of legs. The only element that kept me in prosthetics was the reminder from doctors, family, and therapists of the time and money they took to create. 

<p>At every possible opportunity, I would abandon the legs in favor of running on my hands -- or later in life, using a skateboard. I found that the practicality and affordability of these two options allowed for more financial and logistic freedom for getting around the everyday world. If I was traveling and something on my skateboard broke, I could buy a replacement locally (and cheaply). If a glove got torn up on a hike, I could wrap some duct tape around it. My family had always focused on simple and practical solutions to any physical challenges I might face, and eventually I learned how to "MacGyver" my way out of situations as well.

<p>I found out about <a href="http://www.openprosthetics.org">www.openprosthetics.org</a> in March, and immediately fell in love. <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=120271945"> NPR described the creator</a>, Jonathan Kuniholm's mission, as an "open-source collaboration that makes its innovations available to anyone." 

<p>One of the most interesting examples was the reviving an old upper extremity prostheses that had been originally developed in the 1920s or '30s. Named the Trautman Hook, it consisted some rubber bands, three metal parts, and two screws.  All of the designs were posted for free on the site, as well as fabrication costs from different companies around the country. A practical and cost-conscious alternative to the expensive and single function prosthetic paradigm felt like a revelation. Open Source. Some weird, cool concept that only futurists could write about. The Firefox of artificial limbs.

<p>For a bit more perspective on the cost and difficulties of obtaining a prosthesis, I rang up Cliff Creekmore, the manager of a local Hanger Prosthetics branch in Montana.

<p>"As of July of 2008, a moderate activity prosthesis for a below-the-knee amputee costs about $17,500."

<p>For a double amputee, the expense doubles. And getting insurance to cover more than one leg is a hassle. When you put those costs in context of Aimee Mullins quote, from a financial perspective, buying a prosthesis is a world apart from buying glasses. 

<p>Thankfully, Aimee does go so far as to admit the issues confronted by the average prosthetic user, "Not one pair of my legs is covered by insurance; not one pair of my legs is considered "medically necessary."

<p>And so, in the face of such debilitating costs and access to the prosthetics, it's incredibly liberating to see movements like The Open Prosthetics Project gaining momentum. Could it ever grow large enough to become an alternative to the private routes? I don't know, but I dearly hope so. As we've seen in many other areas, open source competition tends to breed innovation from incumbents, It would be something to one day finally see prosthetics that are adaptable and multi-use without the steep costs we currently experience.

<p>Check out their <a href="http://www.openprosthetics.org/">main site</a> to see some of the finished projects.

<p>And if you want to get into the nuts-and-bolts of developing projects, head to their <a href="http://openprosthetics.ning.com/">Ning site</a>. <br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/>

<br clear="all"><P>Lenore and Windell, that brilliant hacker couple who run Evil Mad Scientist Laboratories, have a complete how-to for making a foldable lap stand for the iPad.

 <blockquote>Sure, that iPad's fun. But doesn't your arm get tired propping up one and a half pounds after an hour or two?
<p>Yes, one thing that the iPad is definitely missing is angle. A laptop has an adjustable screen, and you can just set it on your lap for couchborne surfing. Just set the iPad on your lap and... well... it's sits there taunting you, pointing at the ceiling.
<p>You can try sitting cross-legged like Steve Jobs, angle your knees with the help of the coffee table, or give up and shell out for a tabletop dock.

<p>No, it's not the end of the world. But shouldn't fun new toys just be... fun?
So here is our solution: a DIY adjustable-angle iPad stand for your lap. Inexpensive, cozy, and light. Designed for both portrait and landscape use, and ready to fold up for transport and storage. With a stand, you can use your 'Pad with zero, one, or two hands, and sit how you darn well please.

<p>In the world of processed foods, keeping kosher is a complicated process that can involve individually certifying as many as 100 chemical compounds just to make a single flavoring agent that meets kosher standards.</p>

<p>The problem is where the compounds come from. In the 1930s, Atlanta-area Rabbi Tobias Geffen was asked to help make Coca-Cola kosher. In the process, he realized that glycerin, a chemical additive used to disperse flavors evenly through the soda, was made from rendered animal fat&mdash;and there was no clear way to tell whether the fat came from a kosher animal. Geffen decided that even the molecules mattered. Coca-Cola made their kosher brew with cotton-seed oil glycerin instead, and other rabbis have followed Geffen's lead.</p>

<p>Today, you can spot kosher-for-Passover soda by the distinctive yellow cap. In this case, sucrose subs in as the sweetener, in place of corn syrup, as corn is a banned grain during the Passover holiday.</p>

This has to be one of the strangest looking fruits that you can buy at the supermarket. It's also one of the most useless when it comes to conventional usage &mdash; this member of the citrus family has no pulp or juices; it's all skin and pith. But while you wouldn't squeeze this one over veggies or in your afternoon tea, its rind is a complement to almost anything and can be seen on many a fancy restaurant's menu. 
<p>
Buddha's Hand hails from India and parts of China. It may have gotten its name from the way it looks like human fingers, or because it's sometimes used as an offering at Buddhist temples. In parts of Asia, it's used to decorate tabletops and as a natural air freshener. Here in the US, you may have experienced it as <a href="http://www.hangarone.com/fruit3.html">flavored vodka</a>. 
<p>
Instructables.com has a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Candied-Buddhas-Hand-Citron/">quick and easy recipe</a> for candied Buddha's Hand. Here are the basics:<blockquote>
Chop up 1 Buddha's Hand into small strips or cubes. Put them in a pot with 3 cups of water and 3 cups of sugar, and bring to a boil on medium heat. Once it boils, simmer for 45 minutes. Once it becomes candied and syrupy, turn off the heat and let it cool for about a half hour.
</blockquote> 
I should mention that this fruit is not in season right now; you might be able to find it at the supermarket now, but you'll likely have to wait until fall, which is when it's most ready to eat.

I've spent ten years now on Boing Boing, finding cool things that people have done and made and writing about them. Most of the really exciting stuff hasn't come from big corporations with enormous budgets, it's come from experimentalist amateurs. These people were able to make stuff and put it in the public's eye and even sell it without having to submit to the whims of a single company that had declared itself gatekeeper for your phone and other personal technology. 
<p>
<a href="http://www.oblomovka.com/wp/2010/04/01/cd-roms-and-ipads/">Danny O'Brien does a very good job of explaining</a> why I'm completely uninterested in buying an iPad -- it really feels like the second coming of the CD-ROM "revolution" in which "content" people proclaimed that they were going to remake media by producing expensive (to make and to buy) products. I was a CD-ROM programmer at the start of my tech career, and I felt that excitement, too, and lived through it to see how wrong I was, how open platforms and experimental amateurs would eventually beat out the spendy, slick pros.
<p>
I remember the early days of the web -- and the last days of CD ROM -- when there was this mainstream consensus that the web and PCs were too durned geeky and difficult and unpredictable for "my mom" (it's amazing how many tech people have an incredibly low opinion of their mothers). If I had a share of AOL for every time someone told me that the web would die because AOL was so easy and the web was full of garbage, I'd have a lot of AOL shares.
<p>
And they wouldn't be worth much.<p><br />
<p><br />
<b>Incumbents made bad revolutionaries</b><br><br />
Relying on incumbents to produce your revolutions is not a good strategy. They're apt to take all the stuff that makes their products great and try to use technology to charge you extra for it, or prohibit it altogether.<br />
<p><br />
I mean, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/04/01/marvel-comics-for-ip.html">look at that Marvel app</a> (just look at it). I was a comic-book kid, and I'm a comic-book grownup, and the thing that <em>made</em> comics for me was sharing them. If there was ever a medium that relied on kids swapping their purchases around to build an audience, it was comics. And the used market for comics! It was -- and is -- huge, and vital. I can't even count how many times I've gone spelunking in the used comic-bins at a great and musty store to find back issues that I'd missed, or sample new titles on the cheap. (It's part of a multigenerational tradition in my family -- my mom's father used to take her and her sibs down to Dragon Lady Comics on Queen Street in Toronto every weekend to swap their old comics for credit and get new ones).<br />
<p><br />
So what does Marvel do to "enhance" its comics? They take away the right to give, sell or loan your comics. What an improvement. Way to take the joyous, marvellous sharing and bonding experience of comic reading and turn it into a passive, lonely undertaking that isolates, rather than unites. Nice one, Misney.<br />
<p><br />
<b>Infantalizing hardware</b><br><br />
Then there's the device itself: clearly there's a lot of thoughtfulness and smarts that went into the design. But there's also a palpable contempt for the owner. I believe -- really believe -- in the stirring words of the <a href="http://makezine.com/04/ownyourown/">Maker Manifesto</a>: if you can't open it, you don't own it. Screws not glue. The original Apple ][+ came with <em>schematics</em> for the circuit boards, and birthed a generation of hardware and software hackers who upended the world for the better. If you wanted your kid to grow up to be a confident, entrepreneurial, and firmly in the camp that believes that you should forever be rearranging the world to make it better, you bought her an Apple ][+.<br />
<p><br />
But with the iPad, it seems like <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/03/16/tim-bray-on-the-ipho.html">Apple's model customer is that same stupid stereotype of a technophobic, timid, scatterbrained mother</a> as appears in a billion renditions of "that's too complicated for my mom" (listen to the pundits extol the virtues of the iPad and time how long it takes for them to explain that here, finally, is something that isn't too complicated for their poor old mothers).<br />
<p><br />
 The model of interaction with the iPad is to be a "consumer," what William Gibson memorably described as "something the size of a baby hippo, the color of a week-old boiled potato, that lives by itself, in the dark, in a double-wide on the outskirts of Topeka. It's covered with eyes and it sweats constantly. The sweat runs into those eyes and makes them sting. It has no mouth... no genitals, and can only express its mute extremes of murderous rage and infantile desire by changing the channels on a universal remote." <br />
<p><br />
The way you improve your iPad isn't to figure out how it works and making it better. The way you improve the iPad is to buy iApps. Buying an iPad for your kids isn't a means of jump-starting the realization that the world is yours to take apart and reassemble; it's a way of telling your offspring that even changing the batteries is something you have to leave to the professionals.<br />
<p><br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=doherty+hypercard+ipad&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">Dale Dougherty's</a> piece on Hypercard and its influence on a generation of young hackers is a must-read on this. I got my start as a Hypercard programmer, and it was Hypercard's gentle and intuitive introduction to the idea of remaking the world that made me consider a career in computers.<br />
<p><br />
<b>Wal-Martization of the software channel</b><br><br />
And let's look at the iStore. For a company whose CEO professes a hatred of DRM, Apple sure has made DRM its alpha and omega. Having gotten into business with the two industries that most believe that you shouldn't be able to modify your hardware, load your own software on it, write software for it, override instructions given to it by the mothership (the entertainment industry and the phone companies), Apple has defined its business around these principles. It uses DRM to control what can run on your devices, which means that Apple's customers can't take their "iContent" with them to competing devices, and Apple developers can't sell on their own terms.<br />
<p><br />
The iStore lock-in doesn't make life better for Apple's customers or Apple's developers. As an adult, I want to be able to choose whose stuff I buy and whom I trust to evaluate that stuff. I don't want my universe of apps constrained to the stuff that the Cupertino Politburo decides to allow for its platform. And as a copyright holder and creator, I don't want a single, Wal-Mart-like channel that controls access to my audience and dictates what is and is not acceptable material for me to create. The <a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/03/08/iphone-developer-eul.html">last time I posted about this</a>, we got a string of apologies for Apple's abusive contractual terms for developers, but the best one was, "Did you think that access to a platform where you can make a fortune would come without strings attached?" I read it in Don Corleone's voice and it sounded just right. Of <em>course</em> I believe in a market where competition can take place without bending my knee to a company that has erected a drawbridge between me and my customers! <br />
<p><br />
<b>Journalism is looking for a daddy figure</b><br><br />
I think that the press has been all over the iPad because Apple puts on a good show, and because everyone in journalism-land is looking for a daddy figure who'll promise them that their audience will go back to paying for their stuff. The reason people have stopped paying for a lot of "content" isn't just that they can get it for free, though: <em>it's that they can get lots of competing stuff for free</em>, too. The open platform has allowed for an explosion of new material, some of it rough-hewn, some of it slick as the pros, most of it targetted more narrowly than the old media ever managed. Rupert Murdoch can rattle his saber all he likes about <a href="http://boingboing.net/2009/11/08/rupert-murdoch-vows.html">taking his content out of Google</a>, but I say <em>do it, Rupert</em>. We'll miss your fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a percent of the Web so little that we'll hardly notice it, and we'll have no trouble finding material to fill the void. <br />
<p><br />
Just like the gadget press is full of devices that gadget bloggers need (and that no one else cares about), the mainstream press is full of stories that affirm the internal media consensus. Yesterday's empires do something sacred and vital and most of all <em>grown up</em>, and that other adults will eventually come along to move us all away from the kids' playground that is the wild web, with its amateur content and lack of proprietary channels where exclusive deals can be made. We'll move back into the walled gardens that best return shareholder value to the investors who haven't updated their portfolios since before eTrade came online.<br />
<p><br />
But the <a href="http://www.tbiresearch.com/here-is-why-the-ipad-wont-save-the-magazine-industry-2010-3">real economics</a> of iPad publishing tell a different story: even a stellar iPad sales performance isn't going to do much to staunch the bleeding from traditional publishing. Wishful thinking and a nostalgia for the good old days of lockdown won't bring customers back through the door. <br />
<p><br />
<b>Gadgets come and gadgets go</b><br><br />
Gadgets come and gadgets go. The iPad you buy today will be e-waste in a year or two (less, if you decide not to pay to have the battery changed for you). The real issue isn't the capabilities of the piece of plastic you unwrap today, but the technical and social infrastructure that accompanies it. <br />
<p><br />
If you want to live in the creative universe where anyone with a cool idea can make it and give it to you to run on your hardware, the iPad isn't for you.<br />
<p><br />
 If you want to live in the fair world where you get to keep (or give away) the stuff you buy, the iPad isn't for you.<br />
<p><br />
If you want to write code for a platform where the only thing that determines whether you're going to succeed with it is whether your audience loves it, the iPad isn't for you.</p>

<p>

My <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2010/03/31/a-first-look-at-ipad.html">initial hands-on review of the iPad for Boing Boing</a> mentioned <a href="http://periodictable.com/ipad/">The Elements</a>, one of a handful of apps built specifically for iPad available for review prior to Saturday's public launch. After spending some quality time with the app, I can say The Elements is my favorite at this very early stage. We've covered previous iterations of <a href="http://theodoregray.com/">Theodore Gray</a>'s gorgeous periodic table series before -- <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rh%3Di%253Astripbooks%252Cp_27%253ATheodore%2520Gray%26field-author%3DTheodore%2520Gray%26page%3D1&tag=boingboing06-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957">books, posters, puzzles</a>, but it's as if all of that was a sketch, and this app the real intended execution of his project. <a href="http://periodictable.com/ipad/">The Elements</a> transforms a familiar scientific reference into a dazzling, living book that delights the eye and tickles the neurons. It really does hint at the possibilities promised by Apple for iPad: a device that makes it possible to merge book, game, entertainment, reference app, internet search, and who knows what else in a new and pleasingly hands-on way. 
<p>
After the jump, many more screengrabs, and a video of the device playing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lehrer">Tom Lehrer</a>'s Elements Song, an awesome little geek easter egg accessible from within the Elements for iPad.<p>

<hr>

<p>

<p>The app will sell for $13.99, and was developed for <a href="http://touchpress.com/">Touchpress</a> by John Cromie of <a href="http://www.skylark.ie/company/home.asp">Skylark Associates</a> in Ireland, with some coding also by Gray. <a href="http://nickmannphotography.com/">Nick Mann</a>, who took most of the rotation photographs, using Canon cameras and lenses (Gray says they shot so many stills in the course of developing the project's image base, more than a quarter million, they wore out several sets of shutters).<br />
<p><br />
The basic idea is this: view the entire periodic table on launch. Select an element, see some data, and a "movie" of a representation of that element. Advance to a second page, and see touch-spinnable icons of more real-world representations of that element. Select  one of those, and you get a detail view which can also be presented in 3D, viewable with glasses sold separately (at <a href="http://periodictable.com/ipad/">$4.95</a>). Each element's detail view allows you to connect to <a href="http://WolframAlpha.com">Wolfram Alpha</a> for live data: for instance, look up the current price of gold, or scan the thermodynamic properties of antimony. The connection speed on that feature feels a little pokey in this early edition.<br />
<p><br />
The app was developed in great haste, without much lead time provided by Apple. Given the speed involved in development, the end result really is impressive: stable, fast, and a joy to meander around in. Gray imagines other forms of interaction with elements for future editions, but there's plenty to work with even in version 1.0.1.</p>

After spending some quality time with the app, I can say The Elements is my favorite at this very early stage. We've covered previous iterations of Theodore Gray's gorgeous periodic table series before -- books, posters, puzzles, but it's as if all of that was a sketch, and this app the real intended execution of his project. The Elements transforms a familiar scientific reference into a dazzling, living book that delights the eye and tickles the neurons. It really does hint at the possibilities promised by Apple for iPad: a device that makes it possible to merge book, game, entertainment, reference app, internet search, and who knows what else in a new and pleasingly hands-on way. After the jump, many more screengrabs, and a video of the device playing Tom Lehrer's Elements Song, an awesome little geek easter egg accessible from within the Elements for iPad....&lt;br clear="both" style="clear: both;"/&gt;

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKynwgUOZJo">Video</a> and screengrabs in this post: a first hands-on experience of the free <a href="http://marvel.com">Marvel Comics</a> app for iPad, produced with <a href="http://www.comixology.com/">Comixology</a> (who produced a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/comics/id303491945?mt=8">popular iPhone app</a>). Word is that more than 500 titles will be available through the application at time of launch on Saturday. The pre-launch copy of the application I'm testing shows many titles offered at $1.99, and a number of selections also available for free. All the Marvel classics are here: <em>Avengers, X-Men, Hulk, Spider Man, IronMan, Captain America</em>, and a number of newer titles. User interface details of note: the ability to finger-flip through, page by page; scrollable bar of thumbs for all pages at the bottom of the page view, so you can skip ahead easily; double-click to zoom into an individual frame and finger-flip forward to advance frame by frame instead of page by page. 

<p>
First impression: I like it. Scrolling is intuitive, brisk, and elegant. I'm amazed at how smooth. The store interface makes sense to anyone familiar with iTunes and App store. Flipping and reading, one luminous full-color page at a time, I do not miss paper. When zooming deeper into single frames, to scroll frame-by-frame, transitions (with "animated" option selected) feel almost cinematic&mdash; but sometimes zoomed-in art is not as crisp and high-res as I'd like (it varies by title). Unless I'm missing something, no way to view two pages at a time, as you might with a paper comic. I didn't miss that detail, but others might. And some comics were designed and drawn by the artist with that view option in mind. I'll be interested to see how the app and the content available for it evolve.<p><br />

<br clear="all"><P>I don't usually watch medical dramas, but my friends Craig and Liz are writers on a new show for CBS called <em>Miami Medical</em>, so Carla and I were able to watch a few episodes in advance. It's a compelling, gory, intense, hour-long drama about a team of trauma facility surgeons in -- you guessed it -- Miami. (It's based on <a href="http://surgery.med.miami.edu/x394.xml">Ryder Trauma</a> at Jackson Memorial Hospital.) After three episodes we are hooked. 
<P>Trauma facilities are different than emergency rooms. If you're injured and about to die, you want to be taken to a trauma center, which is staffed by surgeons ready to save your life. Emergency rooms don't have surgeons, they have doctors who evaluate patients and decide whether or not to send them to a surgeon.
<P>When a big accident happens in a city -- a fire, an explosion, a train wreck -- things can get crazy very quickly in a trauma center, and <em>Miami Medical</em>  
throws you in the middle of the frantic life-or-death atmosphere. I'm not a doctor and I've fortunately never been in a trauma center, but Craig tells me the creators of the show went to great lengths to make sure the procedures, jargon, and equipment are accurate. All the instrumentation is real -- in fact, the consulting surgeon, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2749464/filmovote">Dr. Zach Lutsky</a>, has even used the equipment in a few instances to examine cast and crew members.
<P><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/4/1/852910/-Cheers-and-Jeers:-Thursday">Daily Kos interviewed the show's co-creator, Jeffrey Lieber</a>, who provided a list of some of the nasty accidents viewers can look forward to in the premiere season: "an alligator attack, a  man falling through a ceiling, a gunman in the break room, a man with a pole through his torso, medical care analogized into a common deli sandwich, a loving daughter... who isn't really, a man rolled into the trauma suite with 8,000 dollars strapped to his chest, and an in-hospital stabbing and a 'Do Not Resuscitate' notice tattooed to the middle of someone's chest."
<P>Lana Parrilla (2nd from left in above photo), who was in the weirdly compelling one-season flop <em>Swingtown</em>, is the standout actor in the show.

<p>What should we do in case of climate emergency? 

<p>Science writer <a href="http://twitter.com/elikint">Eli Kintisch</a>, a colleague of mine and a swell guy, has written a book about the controversy and science surrounding geoengineering&mdash;the increasingly less-fringe idea of using technology to manipulate away the effects of climate change. He's put together a <a href="http://hacktheplanetbook.com/safetycard/">clever, little Flash-based guide </a>that explains some of the basics of geoengineering in the style of an airplane safety instruction card. I'm trying, and sadly failing, to come up with a witty joke about returning tables to the upright, locked position. But don't let my shame stop you from checking this out.</p>

<p>Eli's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/047052426X?ie=UTF8&tag=hacthepla-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=047052426X">Hack the Planet</a>, comes out on Earth Day.

It gave me goosebumps. That's about the highest compliment I can pay  
the upcoming iPhone adventure game <a href="http://www.swordandsworcery.com/"><em>Sword & Sworcery EP</em></a>, and just about  
all you need to know for now. They were significant, too, for not just being the goosebumps of that media moment where all elements suddenly align -- where pixel and music work in perfect concert -- but for the kind you get when a game anticipates your demands and provides you with an answer to a question you hadn't even asked yet.

There's a sense in which the <em>EP</em> is being created just for me: not quite that literally, but it <em>is</em> the collective brainchild of designer Craig '<a href="http://www.superbrothers.ca/">Superbrothers</a>' Adams (who you'll remember from his <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/features/morerock.html">just-featured Less Talk, More Rock speech</a>), indie studio <a href="http://www.capybaragames.com/">Capy</a> (also featured here for their <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2009/10/21/like-ghibli-barfing.html">gorgeous <em>Critter Crunch</em> revamp</a> and their <a href="http://boingboing.net/2009/12/09/please-release-me.html"><em>Clash of Heroes</em> handheld masterstroke</a>), and musician <a href="http://jimguthrie.org/">Jim Guthrie</a>, a long-time favorite both for his golden, harmonic pop solo work and his own collaborative output as <a href="http://www.moodymotorcycle.com/">Human Highway</a>.

I managed to get my hands on <em>Sworcery</em> as soon as humanly possible -- before the Game Developers Conference started proper, and away from the chaotic bustle of this year's <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11408749@N05/4428946184/sizes/l/in/set-72157623485985745/">crowded Indie Games Fest pavilion</a>. It was a wise and fortuitous choice -- playing alone on a late night Mission district rooftop -- because <em>Sworcery</em>'s magic demands quiet and careful attention to properly cast its spell. True to his own words in <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/features/morerock.html">that Boing Boing feature</a>, the game is about unspoken dialogue between itself and the player: responding to your own curiosity and whispering questions rather than shouting demands.

Case in point: just watch that video at top, where a single non-reflected mark in its waters practically evokes more mystery and wonder than most scripted turns-of-events in the majority of the triple-A fantasies the games industry has given us in the past few  
years.<center><object width="400" height="600"><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><param name="movie" value="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10067073&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" /><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop.swf?clip_id=10067073&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;fullscreen=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" width="400" height="600"></embed></object></center>

<p>And while the main adventure mode showcased at top is all serenity now, Superbrothers promises higher intensity drama to follow, showcased via a combat mode against the game's Grizzled Boor -- an antagonist that pays slight homage to <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Another_World_%28video_game%29">Another World</a></em>'s dark beast in subtly leading you deeper into its world while never necessarily proving himself not exactly a threat.</p>

<p>Should you decide to take on the Boor, you're presented with this minigame above where here, too, Superbrothers takes their "less talk" mantra to heart, telegraphing your opponent's intentions with visual cues, in loving and open tribute to NES classic <em>Punch-Out!!</em> (see especially <a href="http://unrealitymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/mike_tysons_punch_out_nes_screenshot4.jpg">that 'stunned' star</a> that appears overhead). </p>

<p>These two modes were as many secrets as Superbrothers was willing to publicly disclose in the GDC demo, but with months yet left in its development, there's hints of much deeper layers of involvement ahead -- onion peeled layers that Adams has been drip-feeding though ultra-vague hints through <a href="http://www.superbrothers.ca/wtf.html">his "teletex bulletin" email updates</a> over the past several months.</p>

<p><img alt="yuletide620.jpg" src="http://www.boingboing.net/oimages/yuletide620.jpg" width="620" height="620" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>But this is one I can give away here: if you scroll back through <a href="http://www.swordandsworcery.com/artwork/">the artwork Adams has released to date</a>, one design element should stand out against the rest -- that razor sharp crescent moon hanging behind his otherwise signature field of muted pixels. </p>

<p>Add that to the release schedule of those teletex updates (February 14th and 28th, March 15th and 29th...) and it should <a href="http://www.universetoday.com/guide-to-space/the-moon/moon-phases-2010/">start to snap into focus</a>: your adventure through its world will modify itself based on the phases of moon in the real world. Exactly what shape this will take is another secret Superbrothers won't fully divulge, but there are hints that certain rare mushrooms which pepper the game's landscape will only come out under certain circumstances. </p>

<p>All this adds up to an intricate ecology that rewards multiple playthroughs, rather than a linear and static adventure meant to be experienced once and set aside, and a landscape dotted with people worth meeting and vistas worth traversing. Prior to GDC it was perhaps my most anticipated game of the event (as I might've hinted at myself with <a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/01/28/what-do-indie-gaming.html#previouspost">my iPad-feature-topping-image</a>): coming away, it might just be my most anticipated game of the year.</p>

UC Berkeley Ph.D. student Jeremy Maitin-Shepard, working with Prof. Pieter Abbeel, has developed
software that enables a robot to fold towels. From the abstract to their scientific paper:

<blockquote>
The robot begins by picking 
up a randomly dropped towel from a table, goes through 
a sequence of vision-based re-grasps and manipulations-- 
partially in the air, partially on the table--and ﬁnally stacks the 
folded towel in a target location. The reliability and robustness 
of our algorithm enables for the ﬁrst time a robot with general 
purpose manipulators to reliably and fully-autonomously fold 
previously unseen towels, demonstrating success on all 50 out 
of 50 single-towel trials as well as on a pile of 5 towels.
